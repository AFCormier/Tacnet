Tacnet.io is a work in progress application that allows users to easily share and construct new tactics for games, without registration, installation or annoying ads. 

Tacnet uses TogetherJS for collaboration and Django as a back-end. 

Instructions (run these commands from the root project folder):

1) virtualenv venv

2) source venv/bin/activate (can also run . venv/bin/activate if source isn't available)

3) pip install -r requirements.txt

4) python manage.py runserver (from the inner 'tacnet' folder)
