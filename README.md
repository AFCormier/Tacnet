##Tacnet.io
Tacnet.io is a work in progress application that allows users to easily share and construct new tactics for games, without registration, installation or annoying ads. 

Tacnet uses TogetherJS for collaboration and Django as a back-end. 

##Instructions:

    virtualenv venv
    source venv/bin/activate (can also run . venv/bin/activate if source isn't available)
